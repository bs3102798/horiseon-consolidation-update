# <horiseon-consolidation-update>


## Description

To provide the consolidation of the Style.css elements which were previously over done. This project was to fix this and allow the Style.css file sheet to be more uniform in its depiction. This provides that if some elements have similar traits it can be consolidated. For the information earned, I obtained the abbility to organize, shorten, and understand that for some elements in a Style.css file sheet this can be presented in a more uniform professional way.


## Installation
 
Programs need for this project is to have a Github and visual studio code. Including the starter code from the Professor Farish Kashefinejad Github repository.
